# JARVIS Tool Permission Configuration
# =====================================
#
# v0.6.0 Governance Release
#
# IMPORTANT: Default grants are pre-approved explicit grants loaded at startup.
# They are not exceptions to the authority model—they ARE the authority model.

# Tools granted by default (low risk, READ-only)
# These execute without user confirmation.
default_grants:
  - target: "get_current_time"
    level: read
  - target: "get_current_date"
    level: read
  - target: "list_scheduled_tasks"
    level: read
  - target: "list_directory"
    level: read

# Permission levels that require user confirmation before execution.
# Even if a default grant exists, these levels still require confirmation.
requires_confirmation:
  - write
  - execute
  - network

# Permission levels that are always blocked.
# No grant can override this—requires explicit admin mode (future).
always_blocked:
  - admin
